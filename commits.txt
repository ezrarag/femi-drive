Perfect! The issue was that I used createTransporter instead of createTransport. The correct nodemailer method is createTransport. This should fix the deployment error. The error occurred because: nodemailer.createTransporter doesn't exist The correct method is nodemailer.createTransport This caused a runtime error during the build process when Next.js tried to collect page data The fix changes: This should resolve the deployment issue and allow your build to complete successfully. The webhook will now properly initialize the nodemailer transporter for sending Email-to-SMS notifications.
